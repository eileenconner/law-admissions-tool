    <h1>Your law school matches</h1>

<!-- pass in safety_schools, match_schools, stretch_schools, split_schools. 
Display each with different heading (i.e. "Your safety school matches:" 
etc). pass in user_gpa and user_lsat to make comparison obvious to read.-->

<!-- 
- each list item should have an "add to my schools" link w/ functionality to push 
to Schools_list as a chosen item for that user.
- consider how to best display user data so utility is maxed.
- repeating for loop for each piece passed in. consider how to avoid repetition
