# Spot my School

Spot my School makes it easy for aspiring law students to identify the perfect law schools for them. This app analyzes admission data from the American Bar Association’s 2013 questionnaire, compares it to each user’s GPA and LSAT score, dynamically generates individualized lists of recommended law schools, and categorizes the results by likelihood of admission. School profile pages provide a location map, charts comparing user GPA and LSAT to admitted student statistics, and tuition and living expense numbers. Users can easily add chosen law schools to a personalized list, ensure they have chosen a good distribution of schools, and keep track of their submitted applications.
